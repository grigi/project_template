Sample instructions on how to deploy
====================================

Create Python container
=======================

For this we assume you are using a Linux host with:
 * Python >= 2.6
 * virtualenv

As root, on the server:
-----------------------
# Add a System User (-r) '{{ project_name }}', in directory '/opt/{{ project_name }}'
useradd -r -d /opt/{{ project_name }} -m -s /bin/bash {{ project_name }}
# Change to the container
su - {{ project_name }}

As the Container User:
----------------------
# Create virtualenv in user root
virtualenv --no-site-packages . 

# Confirm or Edit that your ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc contains the following:
source ~/bin/activate

# Log out an back in to your session again

# Do a `which python` to see that you are using the right version
# Result should be something like:
# ~/bin/python
# /opt/{{ project_name }}/bin/python


Deploy project
==============

# In your project root
# Build a source blob:
python setup.py sdist

# Copy the tarball 'dist/{{ project_name }}-0.1.tar.gz' to the Python container

As the Container User:
----------------------
# Install the project
pip install <tarball>
# If anything fails to build, resolve it manually.
# Common causes are lack of a -dev package to build some library against.

# Confirm or Edit that your ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc contains the following:
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="{{ project_name }}.settings.prod"

# Run 'django-admin.py validate' to confirm that your environment is set up correctly

# For static content, make sure that a static folder exists
# By default it is '/opt/{{ project_name }}/static/' for production
# Edit STATIC_ROOT in the settings to change it.

# Now make sure it exists
mkdir /opt/{{ project_name }}/static/

# Collect all the static content in one place, for easy serving :-)
# Make sure to run this after every deployment update
django-admin.py collectstatic


Configuring Apache
==================

Add a configuration file in the apache config directory.
You can use the sample file in '{{ project_name }}/apache-sample.conf' as a base.

Please update references to <CNAME> to the cname of the vhost.
